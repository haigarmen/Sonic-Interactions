Sonic Interaction Designs


# Definitions

### Sonification (Hermann, 2008, ICAD)
1. A technique that:
 uses data as input, and generates sound signals(eventually in response to optional additional excitation or triggering) may be called sonification, if and only if
2. The sound reflects objective properties or relations in the input data.
3. The transformation is systematic.
4. The sonification is reproducible.
5. The system can intentionally be used with different data

### Interactive Sonification
Multiple Sonic Views (Aural Perspectives) required
- And queried by interaction
- Interaction binds multiple sensory signals into perceptual multimodal units
- Interaction embeds us into a closed-loop
- We feel more in control
		- Higher flow / satisfaction
		-	Increased performance / less annoyance
		- The more we can interact with sound the better
