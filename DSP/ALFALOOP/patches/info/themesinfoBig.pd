THEMES choose between dark and light or choose freely by changing background and font-color. With the +/- sign you can try to make the info-text fit into the window... There are only two choices - I hope that one of it does the job. If the text-lines fall out of the window try the "-". The first time you switch \, you may be left with the overlapping text still visible. Just close ALFALOOP and re-open it to remove the overlapping text.
