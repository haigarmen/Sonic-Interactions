INPUT/OUTPUT Input and output of your soundcard. The numbers correspond to the real physical in- and output of your soundcard. If you choose "stereo" for output \, the mono-output will be split up to two similar outs \, panned hard left/right. Level is adjusted in that case (to omit clipping). Stereo-out is only applied for the case of the lacking of a soundcard-mixer. ALFALOOP is a mono-device. Mono makes happy! About monitoring: You NEED direct-monitoring because ALFALOOP will never pass your input-signal to its output directly. If it would \, your signal would be delayed by the latency of your system. Even if your system is extremely fast \, it's still annoying enough. Stick to direct-monitoring - that's where the music happens. If you don't have a fancy soundcard \, build your own direct-monitoring by sending your input-signal to a mixer before entering the computer. The output of the computer goes to the same mixer too. Use sends/aux etc to avoid a real loop! (Don't feed the playback back in...)
